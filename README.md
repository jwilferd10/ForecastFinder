## :wave: Description: 
This application uses openweathermap.org's current day weather forecast to display current conditions on the searched city. When I had first started learning how to code, this particular challenge gave me the most trouble. I didn't know what I was doing wrong and I was spooked to touch it. Many weeks later I decided to come back to this project and at least get ONE thing working. Having scrapped the original code I finally got it to display current weather conditions! There's definitely more to come once I've got more time. I'd like to add a five-day-forecast to this and put more code into this.<br>
<br>
Originally it was supposed to use jquery but back when I first started working on this I didn't understand it quite good. Returning back to this challenge, the jquery connection was taken out and just put together using JavaScript ES6 functions.
