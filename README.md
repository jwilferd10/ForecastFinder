## :wave: Description: 
ForecastFinder is a weather dashboard app that allows users to search for weather information for a specific location using the OpenWeather API. With ForecastFinder, users can quickly and easily find the current weather conditions, as well as a five-day forecast, for any city around the world.

### Features
- **Weather Search**: Users can search for weather information by city name or zip code. The app automatically detects if the input is a zip code and formats the API request accordingly.

- **Current Weather Display**: The app displays the current weather conditions for the searched location, including temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed.

- **Five-day Forecast**: ForecastFinder provides a five-day forecast that includes temperature, weather description, and weather icon for each day.

- **Previous Searches**: The app keeps track of previous searches made by the user, allowing them to easily access the weather information for previously searched cities.

- **User Notifications**: ForecastFinder provides user notifications for successful searches and error handling for invalid inputs or API errors.

- **Responsive Design**: The app is responsive and can be accessed on different devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Thank you so much for checking out ForecastFinder, this has been an educational boon for me and I appreciate any interest in checking the app out. I devoted time into ensuring the code is modularized and potentially useful. It's my hope that this application helps YOU out in anyway possible. Feel free to take a look through the files, Happy Coding!
