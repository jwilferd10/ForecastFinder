## :book: User Story:
**AS A  busy traveler**
- I WANT to see the current weather of a city 
  - SO THAT I can plan for the day
- I WANT a five day forecast 
  - SO THAT I can plan out my week
- I WANT a list of previously searched locations
  - SO THAT I know the weather for each destination 

**GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs**
- WHEN I search for a city
  - THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city
  - THEN I am presented with the five day forecast 
  - THEN I am presented a list of all previously searched locations

## :minidisc: Installation and Usage:
   - Enter the name of the city
   - Current conditions appear on the main box.
   - Five day forecast appears at the bottom of current conditions
   - For each search, previously searched cities will appear under the search input
