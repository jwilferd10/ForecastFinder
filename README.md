## :wave: Description: 
Your Weather Dashboard is a weather app that utilizes openweathermap's API to display weather conditions to the user.

## :book: User Story:
**AS A  busy traveler**
- I WANT to see the current weather of a city 
  - SO THAT I can plan for the day
- I WANT a five day forecast 
  - SO THAT I can plan out my week
- I WANT a list of previously searched locations
  - SO THAT I know the weather for each destination 

**GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs**
- WHEN I search for a city
  - THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city
  - THEN I am presented with the five day forecast 
  - THEN I am presented a list of all previously searched locations
